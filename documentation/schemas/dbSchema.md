# DB Schemas for Travel Buddy
The DB Schemas provide a visual explanation for how the DB structure will look like and what is being worked with.

DB Schemas are only a guideline as to how the DB structure should be approached, 
they are not used to display the exact collaboration between entities, 
for that please refer to the [Use Case Diagrams]() or [Process Flow Diagrams]().
